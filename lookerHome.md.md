## Welcome!

The Business Intelligence team has been hard at work collecting data from across channels to assemble these reports. We hope that you find them helpful!

If not, please let us know. Do you need data from another channel? Do you have questions about the numbers? Not sure how to make Looker do what you need it to? Email Nick Veith (nveith@aimmedia.com) or Jamie McAllister (jmcallister@aimmedia.com).
